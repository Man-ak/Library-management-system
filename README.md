# Library Management System with GUI

This Python project implements a Library Management System with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using the `tkinter` library. The system allows librarians to log in, register, and perform various library operations, including adding, removing, issuing, and viewing books.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Librarians can log in with their username and password. New librarians can register by providing their credentials.

- **Library Operations:**
  - **Add Book:** Librarians can add books to the library, and the system stores them in a list.
  - **Remove Book:** Books can be removed from the library if they exist in the catalog.
  - **Issue Book:** Librarians can issue books to borrowers, effectively removing them from the available books list.
  - **View Books:** A list of available books can be displayed through the GUI.

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. Log in or register as a librarian.
3. Access library management options to add, remove, issue, or view books.

This project provides a straightforward and user-friendly way to manage a library's catalog. It's an ideal starting point for anyone looking to create a similar system with a GUI in Python.
